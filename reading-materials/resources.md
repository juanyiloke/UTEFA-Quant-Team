### Just some reading material for the team. 

##### Reading list for systematic traders:
Source: https://fxgears.com/index.php?threads/recommended-books-for-algo-trading-in-2020.1243/

For our case, due to constraints of time, we will optimize for books that can be used to supplement a project and 
thereby produce a tangible trading system out of it. We shall pick the following 2:

Systematic Trading by Robert Carver:
[book](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uvOsKvPAW2iFOf4X3yRd1fu9Fbj3brdQ/view?usp=sharing)
[accompanying repo](https://github.com/robcarver17/pysystemtrade)


Trading and Exchanges by Larry Harris:
 [book](https://kupdf.net/download/harris-trading-and-exchanges-market-microstructure-for-practitioners-2003_5a3fabeee2b6f54c322cad19_pdf)


Now the above we shall consider as academic reading. For our practical use case, we will apply the method outlined in this [post](
https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-become-a-good-quant-What-technical-skills-should-I-learn-and-improve-if-I%E2%80%99m-a-new-graduate/answer/Ross-Ledehrman?ch=10&share=2ec5d3e5&srid=Cpmp).

Note the step by step nature of the article. Once we've applied that, we can consider the [repository](https://github.com/EliteQuant/EliteQuant)
by EliteQuant for repositories we could use for implementation of the above steps.

Fundamentally, we will roughly try the following:
1) Find a strategy that is employed manually alongside technical indicators.
2) Utilize programming to trade according to indicators.
3) Continuously monitor and adjust strategy according to market and what works/doesn't work.

All throughout  the above, do consider referencing Carver's book as it provides a guideline to designing such trading systems.
For the fundamentals and fun reading, refer to Harris' book. In the interest of time, we will focus on the 2 books above. Any additional 
resources can be considered throughout the workflow.

Now I will list some ideas hashed out by Jonathan (teammate in UTEFA):

"
Some thoughts that may help to find topics:

1. There is a competition called Kaggle. We would learn a lot if we try to tackle some of their competitions. (https://www.kaggle.com/c/two-sigma-financial-news)(https://www.kaggle.com/competitions?searchQuery=finance) (https://www.kaggle.com/c/optiver-realized-volatility-prediction)
2. We can make something assistive to our UTEFA analyst team. For example, designing a program to analyze risk. 
3. We can also find classic quant models and try to replicate them to practice., 
4. As mentioned we are collaborating with STS, an investment club in utsc. We can work on similar project as they do. Therefore, it is easier to receive support too. (Juli might know more about their work than I do)

"

1. and 2. seems to be the most viable currently. The Quora article's step is, as the author describes, roughly what a
market risk quant does. If that's the case, it would certainly be helpful for 2. Now for 1., we would thus need to find a Kaggle
competition which seems intersting and simply compete there. More or less time-series and causal models at that point. Using the EliteQuant repo
would likely be useful.
